// literally.
// matchingAnnotations returns every annotation covering a file, not the first.
//
// Every, because the caller uses the result twice: to decide that a file is
// covered, for which one would do, and to mark a pattern as having covered
// something, for which one will not. Two patterns can legitimately cover the
// same file, and stopping at the first reports the other as annotating nothing
// - the ledger accusing a correct entry of being stale.
//
// The case is narrower than it first looks, and the difference was found by
// trying it rather than by reasoning about it. Two entries listing the same
// path are indistinguishable here, because this marks patterns and identical
// patterns are one key; the version that stopped at the first match passes that
// test. What it does not pass is a specific path annotated alongside a glob
// that already covers it - `internal/testkit/testdata/golden_sample.txt` beside
// `internal/testkit/testdata/**` - where the glob is reached first and the
// specific entry is reported as matching nothing. Folding this tree into
// go-mutants merges two manifests, which is where a broad entry meets a narrow
// one for the first time.
//
// The only wildcard implemented is a trailing `/**`, matched as a prefix so
// that it crosses directory separators. That is what REUSE means by it, and
// path.Match would be the wrong tool for saying so: its wildcards stop at a
// separator, so `testdata/**` would cover a file one level down and not one two
// levels down. go-mutants had exactly that, and the way it fails is the worst
// available - the annotation still matches something, so it is not reported as
// stale, while the deeper files are reported as carrying no licence. A reader
// is then sent to look for a missing header in a file the manifest says is
// annotated: a true sentence about the wrong subject.
//
// go-mutants settled the behaviour by asking the reuse tool rather than by
// reading the specification again, on the ground that a misreading is not
// repaired by the same reading. With `path = ["data/**"]` and a file at
// data/deep/nested.txt, reuse 3.3 reports the tree compliant; changing the
// entry to `data/*` makes it report that file as missing its licensing
// information. Both directions, one tool, no interpretation.
