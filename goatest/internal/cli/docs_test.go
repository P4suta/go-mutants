// verdict vocabulary as well - which is how the missing COMPLETED was found.

// README.md and docs/assurance-contract.md listed eight. A reader of either
// page could not learn what `goatest report --json` meant by the verdict it
// had just printed, and README.md contradicted itself: its exit-code paragraph
// mentioned a "completed operation" its own verdict list did not hold.
//
// The command set is written down four times inside this file alone - the
// constants, the help text, commandHelp, and the dispatch switch - and a fifth
// time in README.md.
