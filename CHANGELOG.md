# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project follows
Semantic Versioning for its CLI, its TOML configuration, and its JSON schemas.
Entries say *why* a change was made, not only what changed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The repository scaffold: module `github.com/P4suta/go-mutants` targeting
  Go 1.26, a stub `cmd/go-mutants` that prints its version, and the complete v1
  dependency set recorded in `go.mod` ahead of the packages that will import
  it. Cobra, `pelletier/go-toml/v2`, bubbletea/bubbles/lipgloss,
  `golang.org/x/tools`, and `golang.org/x/sync` are the runtime set;
  `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6`, `google/go-cmp`, and `pgregory.net/rapid`
  are test-only. Recording them now means the dependency decision is reviewable
  as one commit instead of arriving piecemeal.
- One pinned toolchain in `mise.toml` — the Go compiler included — with tasks
  for `bootstrap`, `build`, `test`, `test-integration`, `fmt`, `lint`, `check`,
  `dogfood`, `package`, and `hooks`. Every gate is defined exactly once there,
  so `just`, the git hooks, and CI cannot drift apart; `justfile` and
  `lefthook.yml` are deliberately thin shims over it.
- CI as three workflows with every action pinned by commit SHA,
  `permissions: contents: read`, per-ref concurrency, and a timeout on every
  job: `ci.yml` (quality, a three-OS test matrix, artifacts, dogfood),
  `nightly.yml` (fuzz and property placeholders), and `release.yml` (verify,
  then a draft-only release job that is the sole holder of `contents: write`).
  Dependabot watches actions and Go modules weekly.
- `.go-mutants.toml`, the configuration this project will dogfood itself with,
  written out in full with comments so the v1 surface is reviewable before the
  strict decoder exists.
- `docs/` covering the instrument-once schemata design and the S/C/D guard
  forms, the typestate pipeline, coverage-guided selection, the 11-family
  operator catalogue with its profile tiers, the full configuration surface,
  the JSON contracts, the Stryker projection boundary, and the release
  checklist. Every page states plainly that it describes planned behaviour, so
  the documentation can be reviewed now without ever claiming working software.
- `.gitattributes` pinning `* -text`. Mutant identities hash exact source
  bytes, so a CRLF checkout would silently change every ID; byte-exact
  checkouts are a correctness requirement here, not a preference.
- Licensing and policy files: dual `MIT OR Apache-2.0` with `LICENSES/` and
  `REUSE.toml` annotations for the files that cannot carry an inline SPDX
  header, plus `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and
  `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

### Notes

- `dogfood` and `package` are honest placeholders that echo and exit 0. They
  exist as named tasks and as CI jobs so that self-mutation and packaging can
  never be bolted on without a gate; they become real in the later phases.
- The operator catalogue enumerates 42 rules while the design plan's headline
  says 43. The enumeration is treated as authoritative for now and the
  discrepancy is recorded in `docs/operators.md` for the registry phase to
  resolve deliberately.
